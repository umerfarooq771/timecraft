# **TimeCraft**

### Automated Feature Engineering for Time Series Data

**`timecraft`** is a Python library designed to simplify and automate feature engineering for time series datasets. It enables data scientists and engineers to extract meaningful insights, preprocess data, and generate advanced features with minimal effort.

## **Features**
- **Statistical Features**: Generate rolling window statistics like mean, variance, skewness, etc.
- **Resampling**: Easily resample time series data to different frequencies (daily, weekly, etc.).
- **Normalization**: Apply robust scaling techniques (z-score, min-max, log transformation).
- **Time-Based Features**: Extract calendar-related features (day of the week, month, season).
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use PCA or other techniques to create unique, compact features.

## **Installation**

Install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install timecraft
